me: How would i do the cutscenes/show the attacks?
me but answering: uh, maybe a new window is made which shows a little graphic or just don't do it, ya know? let them imagine.

## BASICS
characters have health, damage, speed, and armor

speed decides who goes first
armor protects health unless it's broken
damage subtracts health
health upon reaching zero means the victory for the one who has not died.

statuses (all bypass armor):
poison- fixed damage over time 4 turns
sleep- turn is skipped for 1 or 2-5 turns
bleed- incremental damage over time 3 turns
paralyze- chance to not land a hit
confusion- chance to hit self with standard 15% of health
decay- drains COST
burn- damage over time + speed debuff
frozen- lowers speed + extra damage to hp

There's a COST to all moves (maybe)
Attacks gain COST
Abilities spend COST
