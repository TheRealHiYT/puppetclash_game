# PuppetClash_TheGame


(how i wanted the characters to be, but I'm not too good. Really, I focused more on the individual characters rather than their interaction in a fight. They don't seem that balanced, but if everyone's super then no one is. So it may fix itself.)
## "Gods" 
Nosear - like the evil mirror of your opponent

Ogel - very random 

## Beast
Ichika - high damage (if the opponent actually lands a hit, they are able to use some of their moves to their fullest)

Izmir - like a brawler and/or a snowballer (very dumb character, lorewise)

## Human
Alexander - all-rounder (ult is based on the indomitable human spirit)

## Undead (kinda of a joke class as they were made on a whim)
Skeleton - built like a mini-tank

Zombie Octopus - dancer/annoyance

## Secret (password protected so only accessible to devs but not really important)
Lineworks - glass cannon

??? - (if we can get the game basically done, we could make a dev character for you.)
