# PuppetClash_TheGame


(how i wanted the characters to be, but I'm not too good. They don't seem that balanced, but if everyone's super then no one is.)
## "Gods" 
Nosear - like the evil mirror of your opponent

Ogel - very random 

## Beast
Ichika - high damage

Izmir - like a brawler and/or a snowballer

## Human
Alexander - all-rounder

## Undead
Skeleton - built like a tank

Zombie Octopus - dancer/annoyance

## Secret
Lineworks - glass cannon
